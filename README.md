# Credit-Card Welcome to my credit card default prediction project! The main objective of this project is to build and compare two machine learning models that predict whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payments or not. Specifically, I have developed a logistic regression model and a tree-based model (decision trees) to tackle this problem. The data used in this project contains various features that describe each customer's demographics, credit history, and current financial status.

In order to build these models, I have first preprocessed and cleaned the data to ensure that it is ready for analysis. This included handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming variables as needed. Next, I split the data into training and testing sets, where I used the training set to fit and optimize the models, and the testing set to evaluate their performance.

After building the models, I compared their performance metrics to determine which one is better at predicting credit card defaults. Some of the key metrics I used for this comparison include Gains table, KS plot, and ROC-AUC score. Based on these metrics, I concluded which model is more suitable for this problem and why.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into predicting credit card defaults and how machine learning models can be used to solve this problem. I hope you find it informative and engaging, and please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
